# Ok, so who are you *really* ?  


Hey Yaâ€™ll! 

I am a Caribbean-born (Trinidad and Tobago), mid-twenties lady living in the midwestern region of the United States.

During the day, I work as a full-time software developer creating large medical applications. In the evenings, I am typically curled up on my couch fulfilling digital illustration orders for my company Dots. by Dev [(dotsbydev.com)](https://dotsbydev.com/).

Outside of work, you can find me tending to my plant children (indoors or in my very large vegetable garden), bicycling on trails, paddle-boarding, and working on or traveling in my Jeep Wrangler. 

Thanks for stopping by, 

Devina
