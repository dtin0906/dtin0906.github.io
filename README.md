# Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. I am a certified Scrum Master with over 5 years of experience leading Agile teams that deliver secure, cloud-native solutions in AWS and Kubernetes environments. My work blends a strong foundation in Agile frameworks with a passion for clear technical communication, AI adoption, and building collaborative remote cultures.

## Agile Leadership and Cloud Platforms

I have guided cross-functional teams working on:

- AWS Cloud infrastructure and automation
- Kubernetes-based deployments
- Application development for enterprise platforms
- Infrastructure as Code practices and DevOps workflows

My leadership approach emphasizes transparency, continuous improvement, and measurable outcomes. In my recent roles, I facilitated sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives while supporting teams in adopting tools such as Jira, Confluence, and Miro.

## AI-Enhanced Workflow

I am an advocate for leveraging AI to improve delivery and collaboration. My toolbox includes:

- ChatGPT for documentation drafts and knowledge sharing
- GitHub Copilot to assist teams with code examples and automation scripts
- Jira AI to streamline backlog refinement and reporting

## Technical Writing and Documentation

In addition to my Agile work, I have produced and edited technical content that supports product adoption and team alignment. While proprietary deliverables for Centene cannot be shared publicly, I am glad to discuss my experience creating:

- User guides and process documentation
- Knowledge base articles
- Release notes and executive reports
- Monthly organization-wide newsletters
- Customer-facing email communications regarding upcoming releases, changes, and upgrades
