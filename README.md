# Portfolio
Although most of my technical writing work cannot be displayed per company policies,
I am happy to provide links and a brief description of blogs and articles that I have worked on 
at the U.S. Green Building Council and Bike Stop Cafe. 

## U.S. Green Building Council 
Much of the technical writing I was in charge of at USGBC was through their custom wordpress blog. 
I was in charge of creating content and editting the code of the blog to fit their brand as needed.
Below are a couple links to blog posts and event articles I created.
