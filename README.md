Although my technical writing work for Centene cannot be displayed per company policies,
I am happy to provide links and a brief description of blogs and articles that I have worked on 
at the U.S. Green Building Council and Bike Stop Cafe & Outpost. 

## U.S. Green Building Council 
Much of the technical writing I was in charge of at USGBC was through their custom wordpress blog. 

I was in charge of creating content and editing the code of the blog to fit their brand as needed.
Below are a couple links to blog posts and event articles I created.

I was also in charge of writing monthly newsletters and sending them out using MailChimp.
Below are a few links to archived web versions of the email newsletters I created.

## Bike Stop Cafe & Outpost
At Bike Stop Cafe, I was in charge of creating a monthly newsletter that was sent out via MailChimp. 
The cafe wanted a "home-made" feel to the site. 
Below are a couple links to archived web versions of the newsletters.
