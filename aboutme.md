# Ok, so who are you *really*?

Hey y’all,

Thanks for stopping by.

By day, I’m a Lead Scrum Master with a background in software development. I’m passionate about building collaborative, high-trust teams that deliver cloud-native solutions and embrace continuous improvement. Clear communication and thoughtful leadership are at the heart of everything I do.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me in my garden or with my nose buried in a book (I read around 100 books a year—no exaggeration). I also love going to author signings and book festivals, exploring trails, paddle-boarding, and tinkering with my Jeep Wrangler whenever I have the chance.

As an early bird, I start most mornings with a cup of coffee and an episode of a favorite podcast or a new blog post. If you’re looking for something interesting to read or listen to, here are a few of my go-to picks:

##### Podcasts
- [On The Ledge](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-the-ledge/id1211183700)
  A lovely British podcast teaching you how to care for houseplants.
- [Greater Than Code](https://www.greaterthancode.com/)
  A thoughtful series on creating a diverse, sustainable culture in tech.
- [Old Fashioned On Purpose](https://www.oldfashionedonpurpose.com/)
  A soothing reminder to slow down and enjoy simplicity.

##### Blogs
- [I'd Rather Be Writing](https://idratherbewriting.com/)
  My favorite place for tips on documenting APIs and improving technical communication.
- [The Home Edit](https://www.thehomeedit.com/blog/)
  Because who doesn’t love a well-organized pantry?
- [She Can Code](https://shecancode.io/shecancode-blog)
  An inspiring blog celebrating women in tech.

Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to get to know me.

Joyfully,
Devina
