# Ok, so who are you *really*?

Hey y’all,

Thanks for stopping by.

By day, I’m a Lead Scrum Master with a background in software development. I’m passionate about building collaborative, high-trust teams that deliver cloud-native solutions and embrace continuous improvement. Clear communication and thoughtful leadership are at the heart of everything I do.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me in my garden or with my nose buried in a book (I read around 100 books a year—no exaggeration). I also love going to author signings and book festivals, book-binding, and hiking.

As an early bird, I start most mornings with a cup of tea and a stroll around my vegetable garden.
If you’re looking for something interesting to read, here are a few of most recent picks:

##### Reading Recommendations
- This Is How You Lose The Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone
- Babel (Or anything written by R.F. Kuang)
- Listen Like You Mean it by Ximena Vengoechea
- Shatter Me Series by Tahereh Mafi

Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to get to know me.

Joyfully,
Devina
