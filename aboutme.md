# Ok, so who are you *really* ?  

Hey Yaâ€™ll! 

Thanks for stopping by.

During the day, I work on an Agile Scrum team as both a software developer and scrum master in training. I am currently seeking a position as a Scrum Master or Project Manager. 

I am detail oriented and strive to communicate clearly and efficiently, whether that be through the written or spoken word.

Outside of work, you can find me tending to my garden, bicycling on trails, paddle-boarding, and working on or traveling in my Jeep Wrangler. 

As an early bird by nature, part of my morning routine includes listening to an episode of a podcast or reading a blog post. If you find yourself looking for some new entertainment, check out my favorite podcasts and blogs below.
