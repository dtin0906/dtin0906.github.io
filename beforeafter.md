## How Do I Look?
Picture this, your friend (we'll call them Jordan) is preparing to go to a private networking event downtown. Jordan is hoping to secure an investor for their firm and has enlisted your help in making sure the outfit they choose is appropriate. After putting on the selected piece, they spin around slowly - offering you a chance to see any imperfections or flaws in the outfit before you draw a conclusion. In the end, you suggest that Jordan switch out the blue shoes for black ones and remove the blazer. 

This same approach is how I go about editing. Upon recieving a piece of writing, I try to envision the author as my friend asking about their wardrobe choices. This helps me put the author's vision first and center any additions, withdrawals, and changes around their voice. Follow along with me as I walk you through my process for transforming an unimaginitive list of thoughts into a well dressed blog post. 

## Dressing Up For Docker
Please note that I cannot make further edits on the company's Confluence page (where the document lives). 
All edits have been created using -Bear-, a plain text editor.

#### This is our starting point.  


At first read, I am delighted to see that the author has well defined categories of points and that each of the bullets are complete thoughts. Since I know that this post will be part of an educational blog for new hires at the company, I already have enough information to form an angle.
From here, I can start to focus in on the structure of the post. 
We know that this blog is being used for onboarding purposes, which means that the -Get Started and Tutorials- section should be moved to the top, followed by -What is the Docker Engine-. This places -What is a Container?- last, since it is potentially repeating information already in the previous section. The reference section will be placed to the side for the time being.
